# PY-CL-Functions

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Python function count_vowels which counts the number of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) in a given string. It includes the implementation of the count_vowels function, an entry point script `app.py` to interactively test the function, and unit tests `lab_test.py` to ensure its correctness.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It allows users to interactively test the count_vowels function by inputting a string and receiving the count of vowels in the string.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the count_vowels function. The function counts the number of vowels in a given string, including both lowercase and uppercase vowels.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the count_vowels function. It ensures that the implemented function behaves correctly by testing it with various input cases, including strings with no vowels, strings with only lowercase vowels, strings with only uppercase vowels, and strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase vowels.

  - test/
    - lab_test.py


## Getting Started

- Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
- Run the `app.py` file to interactively test the count_vowels function.
- Follow the prompts to input a string and see the count of vowels in the string.

## Testing

- Open the `src/test/lab_test.py` file.
- Run the `lab_test.py` file to execute the unit tests.
- Ensure that all tests pass, indicating that the count_vowels function works correctly.

## Conclusion

This project provides a practical demonstration of counting vowels in a string using Python. By exploring the `lab.py` file and running the tests in `lab_test.py`, users can understand the implementation and behavior of the count_vowels function, improving their Python programming skills.

Happy Coding!
